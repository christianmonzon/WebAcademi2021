    <p> Spider-Man 2 is the second movie off the Sam Raimi directed trilogy. This movie is based on a Marvel comic superhero, Spider-Man, and the iconic origin of Queens high schooler, Peter Parker. Because of being a superhero and a regular student, Peter has to choose wether he continues fighting crime or if he continues his life as an average student. Mary Jane Watson, also known as MJ, is his love interest in this movie. Peter feels as if the powers that were given to him are burdens because of how difficult it is to live two lives. Doctor Octopus,the newest villian in town, is out on the loose, and here is where Peter Parker decides who he is meant to be. This is why it is one of my favorite movies. It's about trying to figure out your identity and the sacrafices you have to make to be better.</p>
