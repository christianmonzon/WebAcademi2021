    <p> La Bamba is a biopic of late latino rock 'n' roll pioneer, Ritchie Valens, directed by Luis Valdez. Ritchie Valens is born in a Mexican family in Los Angeles, California in 1941. Still a teenager, he dreamed of being in a band and playing music to people around the world. He picks up the guitar and starts playing small gigs until a record company gives him an offer to release original songs and an album. At just 17 years old, he already started the rock 'n' roll movement, but shortly after his life came to an end because of  plane crash. This movie follows a theme of chasing your dreams and to never regret anything that you do.</p>
