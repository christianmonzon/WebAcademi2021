    <p>Bohemian Rhapsody is a biopic based on the 1970's band Queen and the frontman, Freddie Mercury. It follows the life of Freddie Mercury as he rises to stardom and explores his sexuality. Throughout the movie, Freddie struggles to find his true identity which causes conflicts between the different band members. After creatinf countless hits, they have one of the most iconic concerts in history. The 1985 Live Aid concert helped raise money for the starving kids in Africa. This success would all come to an end once Freddie finds out that his years are limited after he contracted HIV/AIDS. This movie has an occuring theme that true happiness is found within yourself. It teaches you that you should always be true to yourself, which is why it is one of my favorite movies. </p>
