    <h3> One personal value that is important in my life is music. Music is one of the things that keep me motivated. I grew up listening to a lot of music at home and my love for it continued to grow as I got older. About two years ago I decided that I wanted to learn how to play the piano because I loved many songs with piano in them. I only took a few classes before the pandemic started and never went back again. My passion for music grew even more during lockdown which led me to buy a guitar and teach myself. Now I occasionally pick up my guitar and sing while I play. Even though sometimes I am unsure of my future, I know that I will be playing and making music, wether it be on my own or with other fellow musicians. </h3>
