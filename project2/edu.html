    <h3>Something that I find very valuable is my education. I'm aware that many kids like me don't have the oppurtunity to learn the things that we do here in Thomas Edison and I'm very grateful. Recently I have decide that I would like to major in Psychology in college. This means that I would have to work very hard in high school in order to ensure that I'll do well in my major. I look at many of my friends who are working hard in order to pass which motivates me to keep on going as well. My mom immigrated to the United States so that I can have a better future than I would living in Guatemala. I wouldn't want to dissapoint my mom. I plan to keep studying and to never give up on my dreams. </h3>
